it started with me camping the IHubs, but sadly I could only watch as @Blood Raider Goomb killed some random stuff.
Then Balls Deep logged out a Cyno at the iHub and formed retries which I thought about dropping but decided against it, so I switched to another Ihub where Balls Deep were sitting in a Bait Domi Navy....
After some hours I was bored so I switched to MinMil comms where they said 2 Astartes and 2 Oneiros are gatecamping in Auga/Ama.
So I move over there just to find Balls Deep in 10 Tornados. I warped to Ama gate at 0 and wanted to see if they lock the Arazu... yes they did, I clicked jump but they deleted me before the Jump was executed 💀
So then I burn to Rens to reship and go to Egmar area where I am super lucky to find a small cruiser gang. 1 Vaga, 1 Scythe Fleet, 1 Scythe....
I disrupt the Vaga and they aggress me... everything is cool now... except for I forgot the fuel to open the cyno .... so I just feed another arazu...
now I buy a third one and decide to drop on a Gatecamp in Starkman. Finally it all works, but my PC almost crashes jumping in and the phantasm and the other stuff gets away. <_<
Then AmarrMil tries to bait me out with a Tempest + Geddon but I don't take the bait. I almost did because I was so frustrated.
Then I camped Vard where the FL33T station was reffed. In case of a fight, maybe I could third party on something... but nobody showed up and no fight happened.
In between I also camped an Amarr supply depot hoping some exeq navy would show up but nothing....

Blopsing is not as cool as I thought 💀 My goal was to kill one cruiser or bigger in the warzone... and I failed... could have just undocked a Bellicose or Thrasher Fleet and get more fun 😢",Crashes,"Crashes (Unexpected shutdowns, freezes, or application terminations during gameplay or startup, crashes in the game)",,
